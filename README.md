# Hogwarts Legacy Broom

The basic idea behind this project is to control the in-game broomstick in Hogwarts Legacy via a $800 Harry Potter's Nimbus 2000 movie prop replica. This done by the combination of a Adafruit LSM6DS3TR-C (Accelerometer), HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Module (Distance Measuring) Sensor and a Arduino Pro Micro. I essentially turn the broom movie prop replica into a GIANT XBOX 360/One controller by utilising the Arduino Xinput library (created by David Madison). The Arduino connects to the PC as a XBOX 360/One Controller. The Arduino utilises the sensors as a way to input data to determine which button presses to send to PC with Hogwarts Legacy running on it via USB.
